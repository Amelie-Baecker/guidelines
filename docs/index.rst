Compatibility with the EC-Horizon 2020 Open Access requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------

The European Commission has published `Guidelines on Open Access to Scientific Publications and Research Data <http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-pilot-guide_en.pdf>`_ (version 1.0, 11-Dec-2013).
By following the :ref:`literature` it is ensured that specific requirements on bibliographic information about Open Access publications are met.

These requirements are summarized here: :ref:`h2020`.

OpenAIRE Guidelines for specific types of data sources
------------------------------------------------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   literature/index
   data/index
   cris/index


OpenAIRE Validator
------------------
The OpenAIRE Validator service http://validator.openaire.eu allows to test compatibility of data source providers with the OpenAIRE Guidelines.
It provides rule sets that allow to test usage of the OAI-PMH implementation of the data source provider and syntax / semantics of metadata fields according to the OpenAIRE Guidelines.
If validation succeeds the data source can be registered for regular aggregation and indexing in OpenAIRE.
OpenAIRE allows for registration institutional and thematic repositories registered in OpenDOAR, research data repositories registered in re3data, individual e-Journals, CRIS, aggregators and publishers.

.. Guidelines in practice
   ----------------------
   These pages are all open and intended for all stakeholders and data providers to add their experiences and best practices. OpenAIRE colleagues will also add their experiences when new types of data providers engage with OpenAIRE.

   - For literature repository managers
   - For data archive managers
   - For CRIS Managers
